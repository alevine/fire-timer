# Fire Timer

A simple plugin adding an in-game timer when the user lights a fire.

### Why?

Fires can last anywhere from 100 to 199 ticks before dying out. If a player wishes to know when it would be likely that their most recent fire would go out, this plugin may be useful. By default, the plugin will start a timer (overriding any previously created timers) after a fire is lit. It will be green for the first 100 ticks, then turn orange until the 150th tick, then red.
